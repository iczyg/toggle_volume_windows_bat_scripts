Started off trying to toggle volume of certain application on and off.
Using application name was unreliable, so found a way to find the application ID and pipe it into the command.
Used a text file storing an odd or even number, reading and writing to it to toggle between on and off.  Could also use 1 and 0 too I guess.

Many tests were made because there was a bug I couldn't find.  Bug was a missing '%' sign.  Always fun when that happens...
